- There are 2 types of implementation of interfaces.
  1. Implicit Interface Implementation
  2. Explicit Interface Implementation.
- A class has to explicitly implement multiple interfaces if these interfaces have methods with identical names.
- If an interface has a method name identical to the name of a method declared in the inheriting class, this interface has to be explicitly implemented.
