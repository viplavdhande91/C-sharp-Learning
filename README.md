# C# Abstraction

## Important points: 


1. Abstract class: is a restricted class that cannot be used to create objects (to access it, it must be inherited from another class).

2. Abstract method: can only be used in an abstract class, and it does not have a body. The body is provided by the derived class (inherited from).




# Why And When To Use Abstract Classes and Methods?




1. To achieve security - hide certain details and only show the important details of an object.

Note: Abstraction can also be achieved with Interfaces, which you will learn more about in the next chapter.
